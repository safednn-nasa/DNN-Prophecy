MNIST MODEL. CLEAN DATA FOR DIFFERENT LABELS. ADV DATA. 
Rules extracted for correct classification to every label and mis-classification. The rules as (i) Test Oracles to mark model runs as pass or fail without the need for GT label, (ii) As a coverage metric: More rules covered by a test set indicates better functional diversity, feature/scenario diversity and defect detection ability.
