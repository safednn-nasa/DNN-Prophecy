Example notebooks demonstrating the use of Prophecy for classification and regression models. (MNIST, ACASXU, GTSRB, TaxiNet)

1. Prophecy_Tool_MNIST.ipynb: Demonstrates the use of Prophecy to extract different types of rules for a CNN for MNIST. It also demonstrates the use of the Marabou tool to prove rules and use of attribution to determine input pixels impacting a rule.

2. ACASX_ProphecyTool.ipynb: Demostrates use of Prophecy to extract rules for the ACASXU model. Demonstrates use of Marabou to prove the rules.
