TaxiNet model provided by Boeing.
Concepts such as shadow, skid, center-line , position and heading angle are annotated manually on a small set of input images.
Prophecy is used to extract rules corresponding to these concepts.
The extracted rules are used to (i) label full dataset, (ii) performing concept-based accuracy analysis, (iii) explain behavior in terms of concepts.
